Welcome to the biggest blog post about an idiot that'll talk about how one person can create the most cursed and the most stupid images possible.

Short bio about me: I've played the Phantasy Star series since 2003, the first game I've ever palyed is PSOGC. And that's it. I am not going to waste your time about my personal history with the series.
